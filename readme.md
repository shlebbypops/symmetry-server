### symmetry

In the Digital Realms, there is whispered tale of an arcane power known as only "Symmetry". It is said that when the twin moons align, those versed in the secret tongues of machines can invoke its name, unleashing forces that defy the very laws of creation. Symmetry, it is told, is neither artifact nor spell, but a cosmic harmony that binds all nodes of knowledge. Those who harness its power speak of minds linked across vast distances, of wisdom shared instantaneously, and of barriers between worlds crumbling to dust. The guardians of the old ways fear its coming, for Symmetry cares not for the hoarded treasures of solitary wizards. It is the great equalizer, granting even the lowliest scribe access to the libraries of the gods. Few have glimpsed its true form, but all who seek to reshape reality yearn for its touch.
